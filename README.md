# Snake
## Author: Ewa TrÄ™bacz

### This project is my own version of the well-known snake game. I've created three game modes. The first one is classic, the snake collect food to grow, it can't hit the edge or cross its body. In the second one, there are obstacles. When the snake hits the obstacle, it losesone life. Snake has three lives, when he loses them all, the game is over. The third mode is the most rare. There are two snakes so players could play with frinds. Snakes are racing for food to get the highest score. The game also has a high score ranking and a tab with a short message from the author.
